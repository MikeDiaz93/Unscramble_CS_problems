Analysis 


Task 0 
We get the values by accessing indices.  It is O(1) time.
(Getting items from a known position in a list is done in constant time)

Task 1 
We apply 2 for loops iterating over the files. The time is 2n, but as 2 is constant, it is O(n) time.
(Iterating over the 2 lists - phone and text logs)

Task 2 

We also have iterations. So the time is O(n).
(Iterating over the list of entries in the phone logs)

Task 3

We have 1 loop and a sorted method. The loop is O(n) time complexity. And the sorted method has complexity O(nlogn). The time complexity for this problem is O(n*log(n)).
(We use the sorted method)

Task 4 

We use 2 for loops and one sorted method. So, the time complexity is the same as the previous problem, O(n*log(n)).
(Also use the sorted method)
