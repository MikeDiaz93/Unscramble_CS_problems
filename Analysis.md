# Time complexity worst Case Big-O-Notation


## Task 0 

Answer: O(1)
Explanation: We get the values by accessing indices.(Getting items from a known position in a list is done in constant time)

## Task 1 

We apply 2 for loops iterating over the files. The time is 2n, but as 2 is constant, it is O(n) time.
(Iterating over the 2 lists - phone and text logs)

## Task 2 

Answer: O(n)
Explanation: We also have iterations.(Iterating over the list of entries in the phone logs)

## Task 3

Answer: (nlog(n))
Explanation: We have 1 loop and a sorted method. The loop is O(n) time complexity. And the sorted method has complexity O(nlogn). The time complexity for this problem is O(nlog(n)). (We use the sorted method)

## Task 4 
Anwser: O(nlog(n))
Explanation: We use 2 for loops and one sorted method. So, the time complexity is the same as the previous problem, O(nlog(n)).
(Also use the sorted method)
